# A_simple_Gradient_Descent_algo
This assignment is part of the [Calculus and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-and-optimization-for-machine-learning?#about) course offered by the Higher School of Economics (HSE) on Coursera.

We are given the **House Pricing** dataset, where there are a lot of information about houses and the target is the price of a house. The goal of this assignment is to find gradient formulas for each parameter of a linear model and then build a gradient descent algorithm for those parameters. The loss function will be the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
